Android App which allows users to enter the notes in a text-box and plays those on clicking a “play” button. The app have following:<br>
1. A Text Box where users can enter notes, e.g. “E1.C1D1..C1D1E1..C1D1..” (notes for song “Tum Hi Ho”). Notes are delimited by N dots(.) (0<=5). Each dot introduces a delay of 50 milli seconds before playing the next note.<br>
2. A Play Button which plays the sounds corresponding to the notes in the text-box. Sound files corresponding to each note can be obtained from https://github.com/pffy/wav-piano-sound/tree/master/wav <br>
3. A Stop Button which stops the currently playing note-sequence.<br>
